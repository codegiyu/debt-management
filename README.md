## My process

I used ReactJS for my build, with TailwindCSS, Zustand for global state management, downloaded icons as SVGs from iconify. I also created a database and a few API routes with ExpressJs and MongoDB for login, register and fetching bonds. That repo can be found at [DMON-Database](https://www.github.com/codegiyu/debt-management-database). 

With proper state management and passing of props I made the website as interactive as I could make it. The checkout page and the register page should be about the most interactive of the bunch.

I also created a custom dummy bond template for suspense while the bonds data is being fetched.

### Built with

- ReactJS
- TailwindCSS
- API
- Zustand
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

I experiences a few firsts during this project. 

- First time creating a suspense dummy to await fetched data instead of some kind of loading screen
- First time creating working MongoDB database and API routes.

I also deepened my knowledge of working with a few things I'm already familiar with like global state management.
